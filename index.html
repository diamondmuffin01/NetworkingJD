      <h2 class="tittles space">OSI Model Overview</h2>

      <h3>Intro</h3>

      <li>

        The <b>Open System Interconnection <i>model</i></b> (<b>OSI</b>)
        was developed in 1977 by the <i>International Organization
          for Standardization</i>.
        This orgnization is responsible for creating different standards,
        which we refer to to as the <b>ISO</b>.
        For example, if you see <i>ISO 7498</i>, that's the standard we
        use to refer to the OSI model.

        <br><br>

        Networks are all about communicating data.
        Data is going to be called different things as it flows
        through our network it goes through different names as it
        goes through those different layers of the OSI model.


        <br><br>
        <img src="img/exp2.gif" alt="example" class="re-size">
        <br><br>

        The OSI model starts at the <i>Physical Layer</i> and ends
        at the <i>Application Layer</i>.
        When we talk about <b>data</b> at layers 7, 6, 5 we
        are talking about <b><i>information</i></b>.
        At layer 4 (transport layer) we're going to call data
        a <b>segment</b>.
        At layer 3 (network layer) we refer to it as a <b>packet</b>.
        At layer 2 (data link layer) we call it a <b>frame</b>.

        At layer 1 (physical layer) is where you've convererted the
        data into 1s & 0s to send it across our medium (wire), we call
        this <b>bits</b>.


      </li>

      <h2 class="tittles space">Layer 1 (Physical Layer)</h2>

        <h3>Intro</h3>


        <li>

          At the bottom of the <i>OSI Model</i> is we'll
          we find our first layer, the <b>physical <i>layer</i></b>.
          This is where bits are transmitted across the network and
          includes all of the physical and elecetrical characteristics of
          this network.
          This is going to tell us whether we're using an <i>Ethernet network</i>,
          whether we're using <i>fiber</i> or <i>copper cables</i>, whether we're
          using <i>Cat5</i> or <i>Cat6</i>, and even if we're using radio
          frequency in the case of <i>Wi-Fi</i>.

        </li>

        <h3>Bits</h3>


        <li>

          Regardless of which method we're using to send our data across this
          first layer, it's always going to occur as binary
          bits.
          These are going to be a series of 1s & 0s.
          Now, each media has a different way of representing thse bits,
          these series of 1s & 0s, because these series of 1s & 0s
          are the basic building blocks of all of our data.
          Now, when we switch between these two modes,
          whether we should read a 1 or a 0 on the network, this is
          called <b>transition modulation</b>.

          Data on a computer network is represented as a <b>binary expression</b>.
          <i>Electrical voltage</i> (on copper wiring) or <i>light</i>
          (carried via fiber-optic cabling) can represent these 1s and 0s.
          The presence or the absence of voltage on a wire can represent a binary 1 or a binary 0, respectively.
          The presence or absence of light on a fiber-optic cable can represent a 1 or 0 in binary.

          <br><br>
          <img src="img/exp3.png" alt="example" class="re-size">
          <br><br>


        </li>

        <h3>Wiring</h3>

        <li>

          As we start understanding that, we then haveto look at the cables
          themself becuase this is also part of our physical layer.
          If we're using someting like a <i>Cat5</i> or a <i>Cat6 cable</i>,
          we may have a certain connector on the end called an <i>RJ45</i>,
          which allows us to plug that cable into the back of a computer or
          into a switch.
          The way that connector is wired is based on a certain standard.
          We use two standards inside our network: <i>TIA/EIA-568A</i> and
          <i>TIA/EIA-568B</i>.
          Now, we'll talk about these and which way these pins actually
          are set up inside, this connector in a future lesson.
        </li>

        <h3>Topology</h3>

        <li>

           There's on thing we have to think about at the physical layer,
           and that's the <b>topology</b> of the network.
                How are we actually running these cables to physically connect
                the different decices together?

          <br><br>

          We can look at this from a Layer 1 perspective.
          Is it a bus, it it a ring, is it a star?
          Is it a hub and spoke?
          How about a full mesh, a partial mesh, or any other topology
          that we discussed.
          When it comes to figuiring this out,
          your're going to look at how they're
          physically cabled, and if you drew them out, that will
          tell you what <i>phyiscal topology</i> you have.

        </li>

        <h3>Synchronizing bits</h3>

        <li>

              For two networked devices to successfully communicate at the
              physical layer, they must agree on when 1 bit stops and
              another bit starts. Two basic approaches to bit
              synchronization include <i>asynchronous</i> &
              <i>synchronous</i>.

              <br><br>

              With the <b>asynchronous</b> <i>bit synchronization</i> approach,
              a sender indicates that it is about to start transmitting by
          sending a start bit to the receiver. When the receiver sees
          this, it starts its own internal clock to measure the subsequent
          bits. After the sender transmits its data, it sends a stop bit to
          indicate that it has finished its transmission.

          <br><br>

          With the <b>synchronous</b> <i>bit synchronization</i> approach,
          it synchronizes the internal  clocks of both the sender and the receiver to
          ensure that they agree on when bits begin and end. A common
          approach to make this synchronization happen is to use an external
          clock (for example, a clock provided by a service provider), which
          is referenced by both the sender and the receiver.


        </li>

      <h3>Bandwidth usage</h3>

        <li>

          <b>Speed</b> is measured by the total amount of data you
          can download or upload in one second. <b>Bandwidth</b>
          is measured by the total amount of data youâ€™re allowed
          to download or upload in one second, which depends
          on your internet plan and the connection type.
          <i>Bandwidth</i> is your maximum possible speed.

          <br><br>

          The two fundamental approaches to <i>bandwidth</i> usage on a network
          are <i>broadband</i> and <i>baseband</i>.

          <br><br>
          <img src="img/exp8.png" alt="example" class="re-size">
          <br><br>

          <b>Baseband</b> is a system that uses a single data
          channel in which the whole bandwidth of the transmission
          medium is dedicated to one data channel at a time.
          <i>Baseband</i> uses all of the frequency of the cable
          all of the time. An example of this is a telephone, because
          picking up the phone uses all of the bandwidth
          allocated to that phone line. Another example of baseband
          network is a wired home thernet network.

          <br><br>

          When we use baseband, we're use a reference
          clock that allows us to send the information for both
          the sender and receiver at the certain time.
          By using this reference clock, this is an example
          of using a <i>synchronous communication</i>.

           <br><br>
          <img src="img/exp9.png" alt="example" class="re-size">
          <br><br>

          <b>Broadband</b> is a multiple data channel system in which
          the bandwidth of the transmission medium carries several
          data streams at the same time.
          <i>Broadband</i> is going to divide our bandwidth into
          seperate channels. An example of this is a TV service
          because a single cable is coming into your home, but
          it carries 200+ channels.

          <br><br>

          In summary baseband is related to digital signals, while
          broadband is related to analog signals.
          <i>Baseband</i> system does not allow digital signals to
          share one medium simultaneously while <i>broadband</i>

          system can
          transmit different data side by side at the same time.

        </li>


        <h3>Multiplexing</h3>

        <li>

          Multiplexing is a technique in wihch several signals are
          combined into one composite signal so that they can
          all be transmitted on a common channel.
          In order to transmit various signals in a single
          common channel, it is important to keep them seperated as
          to not cause interference and to make it possible for
          the receiving end to seperate them.

          <br><br>

          Time-division multiplexing (<b>TDM</b>) supports different
          communication sessions on the
          same physical medium by causing the sessions to take
          turns. For a brief period of time, defined as a
          <i>time slot</i>, data from the first session will be sent, followed
          by data from the second session. This continues until
          all sessions have had a turn, and the process repeats
          itself.

          <br><br>

          A downside to <i>TDM</i>is that each communication session
          receives its own time slot, even if one of the sessions
          does not have any data to transmit at the moment.
          To make a more efficient use of available bandwidth,
          <b>Statistical time-division multiplexing</b>(<b>StatTDM</b>)
          dynamically assigns time slots to communications
          sessions on an as-needed basis.

          <br><br>

          <b>Frequency-division multiplexing</b> <b>FDM</b> divides a mediumâ€™s frequency
          range into channels, and
          different communication sessions transmit their data
          over different channels.

          <br><br>

          Now, for the exam, the good news is you don't need to
          memorize <i>TDM</i>, <i>StatTDM</i>, and <i>FDM</i>,
          but rather you just need to understand that
          <i>multiplexing</i> involves taking some limited
          amount of resource and using it more efficiently.
          <i>Multiplexing</i> allows multiple people to
          use a baseband connection at the same time

        </li>

        <h3><i>Physical Layer</i> Device Examples</h3>

        <li>

          The final thing we need to talk about is
          some examples of Physical/Layer1 devies.
          The most common one is a <i>cable</i>.
          If I have a fiber optic cable or an
          Ethernet cable or a coaxial cable,
          these are all different types of media.
          So, if I have a fiber optic cable and I
          put light in one end, I'm going to get
          light out of the other end. That's
          a physical response, a physical layer
          of the <i>OSI Model</i>.

          <br><br>

          Additionally, beyond wired cables, we also have
          wireless things, things like Bluetooth and Wi-Fi
          and near field communication.
          All of these radio frequencies make up
          the media at Layer1 for those types of networks.

          <br><br>

          The final example is infrastructure devices,
          and that will be things like <i>hubs</i>,
          <i>access points</i>, and <i>media converters</i>.
          All of these devices operate at the bit layer.
          This is going to be a function to just simply repeat
          what they get.

          <br><br>

          Whatever comes in is gonig to go out.
          There's no logic to it, there's no
          intelligence to it.
          Layer1 devies simply repeat whetever
          they're told.
          Later1 is dumb devices.
          They're simply repeaters.
          Whatever they take in, they sind it right
          back out.

        </li>

        <h2 class="tittles space">Layer 2 (Data-Link Layer)</h2>

        <h3>Intro</h3>

        <li>

              The <b>Layer 2</b> of the OSI model, the <b>data link <i>layer</i></b>.
              In the <i>data link layer</i> we're going to package up bits from
              <i>Layer 1</i> and put those into <b>frames</b> and then, we're going to
              take <i>frames</i> and transmit them throughout the network while
              performing some error detection detection, correction,
             identifying unique network devices using <i>MAC addresses</i>,
             and we're going to provide some flow control.
             With <i>Layer 2</i> we deal with things on a <b>logical level</b>.

        </li>

        <h3>MAC address</h3>

        <li>


              A <b>MAC address</b> (<b>media access control address</b>) is a means for
              identifying a device physically and allowing it to operate on a logical topology.
              These <i>MAC addresses</i> are important for dealing with switches and other
              Layer 2 devices.

              <br><br>

              When it comes to identifying <i>MAC addresses</i>, every manufacturer
              of a network card assigns a unique <i>48-bit</i> physical adressing
              system to every network interface card they produce.
              A <i>12-digit hexadecimal</i> number is used to represent
              <i>MAC addresses</i>. <i>MAC addresses</i> are always
              written hexadecimally wherein each of the letter or
              numbers is considered <i>four bits</i>.

              <br><br>
              <img src="img/exp11.png" alt="example" class="re-size">
              <br><br>

              The first <i>24 bits</i> or <i>six letters/numbers</i> as
              you can see here identifies the particular vendor who made that card.
              The second half is going to represent the exact machine it
              belongs to.

              <br><br>
              <img src="img/exp12.png" alt="example" class="re-size">
              <br><br>

        </li>

        <h3>LLC Layer</h3>

        <li>

              The data link layer is the second lowest layer.
              It is divided into two sublayers. The <b>logical link
              control</b> (<b>LLC</b>) <b><i>sublayer</i></b>, and <i>(MAC)
              sublayer</i>.

              <br><br>

              <b>Logical Link Control</b> (<b>LLC</b>) provides
              connection services and allow your recipients to
              acknowledge the messages have gotten where you
              thought thought they were going.

              <i>LLC</i> is the most basic form of <i>flow control</i>, essentially it's
              going to limit the amount of data that a sender can send at once
              and allow the receiver to keep from
              being overwhelmed.


              <br><br>

              <i>LLC</i> also provices basic <i>error control</i> functions
              such as allowing the receiver to inform the sender if their data
              fram wasn't received, or if it was received <i>corrupted</i> and
              it does this by using a <b>checksum</b>.

              Since everything it receives is just a series of 1s &
              0s, the receiver is going to add all of these up and
              the last bit will either be even or odd.
              If it matches, they add them all up and if they're
              <i>even</i>, then, it's going to assume that this was good.
              If you have received a <i>zero</i> that means it was <i>even</i>.

              If the last bit was <i>odd</i>i>, meaning it was a <i>one</i>,
              and they added up all the numbers
              and they got an odd number,
              that means it was good, as well.
              But if not, they can figure that something was bad
              and then ask for a retransmission of the <i>frame</i>.

              <br><br>

              ??? The primary function of LLC is to multiplex protocols over the MAC layer while transmitting and likewise to de-multiplex the protocols while receiving.

          <h3>How is communication <i>synchronized</i>?</h3>

          <li>

                Communication can be synchronized across Layer 2
                according to three different schemes.

                <br><br>

                First we have something known as <b>isochronous <i>mode</i></b>
                which happens when the networks use a common reference clock similar to
                <i>synchronous</i>, yet they also crate time slots for
                transmissions, much like we did with time division multiplexing.
                This has less overhead than either of the other two modes because
                both devices know when they can communicate and for exactly how long.

                <br><br>

                The second method we can use is known as <b>synchronous <i>method</i></b> and
                this is much like <i>Layer 1</i>.
                It's going to involve devices using the same clock.
                But the reason it's different from isochronous is that this is
                going to allow us to have beginning and ending <i>frames</i> and
                and special control characters to tell us when we're going to
                start and when we're going to end based on those beats.
                Networks operate in that devices can only communicate at
                frequencies specified by particular clock cycles.
                Because of this, there isn't a lof of gap time that
                isn't already properly utilized and this becomes a major
                drawback for sychronized mode.

                <br><br>

                Finally we have <b>asynchronous</b> which is going to
                allow each of our network decives to reference their
                own clock cycles and use their own <i>clock cycles</i> and
                their own start and stop <i>bits</i>.
                In this way, there's no real control over when the
                devices are allowed to communicate, and that becomes
                the major drawback here.




          </li>

          <h3>Ending?</h3>

          <li>

                  Now, when we look at <i>Layer 2 devices</i>, we
                  have things like <b>network interface cards</b>,
                  <b>bridges</b>, and <b>switches</b>.
                  In contrast to how a hub is a dumb machine
                  that simply relies on a message coming in and repeating
                  it back out, <i>switches</i> are smarter.

                  They can actually use logic to learn which physical
                  ports are attached to which devices based on their
                  <i>MAC addresses</i>.
                  This way they can send data to specific devices in
                  the network, allowing us to picm up and choose
                  different lines of communication to go to different
                  areas.

                <br><br>

                  ?! Now, we'll talk all about how this works and how
                     these switches do these including things like
                    <i>CAM tables</i> using the <i>MAC addresses</i> and
                    how they're doing the switching across the network in
                    later lessons and we'll go into depth in that
                    because you will need to understand that
                    to understand how networks really work.
                    But for right now,
                    just remember that switches, bridges, and MAC addresses
                    are three great examples of things that operate at Layer 2,
                    the data link layer.

          <h2 class="tittles space">Layer 3 (Network Layer)</h2>

          <h3>Intro</h3>

          <li>

                  At the <b>network layer</b>, we're concerned with
                  routing. <b>Layer 3</b> is all about how we're
                  going to foward traffic, which we refer to
                  as <i>routing uisng logical addresses</i>.

                  <br><br>

                  For example, your computer has an <i>IP address</i>.
                  And that <i>IP adress</i> is either going to be an
                  <b>IP version 4</b> (<b>IPv4</b>) or an <b>IP version 6 adress</b> (<b>IPv6</b>), or
                  both. Both of these are considered <i>Layer 3 protocols</i>
                  <i>IPv4</i>, and <i>IPv6</i> are the most common and popular
                  <i>logical addressing scheme</i>

                 <br><br>

                  We're also going to be concerned with what's known as
                  <b>switching</b>, also known as <b>routing</b>.
                  Not to be confused with <i>switches</i> which are
                  layer 2 devices.

                  <br><br>

          </li>

          <h3>IP address</h3>

          <li>
                  Back in the '80s and '90s, there
                  was <i>AppleTalk</i> for
                  Apple computers.
                  And if you used a Windows or a Novell Network
                  computer, you might have used <i>IPX</i>, which
                  was the Internetwork Packet Exchange.
                  What killed both these off
                  was <b>Internet Protocol</b> (<b>IP</b>)
                  There are other protocols that you could use
                  in <i>Layer 3</i>, <i>IP</i> is just the most
                  common.

                  <br><br>

                  Now, some of those are still existing on some
                  <i>legacy systems</i>, which means old systems
                  in some corporate network.
                  The routing protocol of the internet that
                  we use today is known as <i>IP</i>.
                  Recall <i>IP</i> comes in two
                  variants, <i>IPv4</i> and <i>IPv6</i>.

                  <br><br>
                  <img src="img/exp14.png" alt="example" class="re-size">
                  <br><br>

                  Above is an example of an <i>IP address</i>
                  This is called a <b>dotted-octet <i>notation</i></b> which
                  is four sets of numbers separated by dots.

          </li>

          <h3>How should data be <i>forwarded</i> or <i>routed</i>?</h3>

          <li>

                There are three main ways for data to
                be <i>forwarded</i> or <i>routed</i>.
                Which are <i>Packet switching</i>, <i>Circuit switching</i>, <i>Message switching</i>.

                <br><br>

                The most commonly used on in a network is going to be
                routing, which is also known as <b>packet switching</b>.
                This is where data is divided into <b>packets</b> and then
                <b>forwarded</b> on based on it's <i>IP address</i>.

                <i>Packets</i> are going to take different routes, and
                we don't care which route it takes, as long as it gets
                to its final destination.

                <br><br>

                When we talk about <b>circuit switching</b>, though,
                this where we want to have the same path each and
                every time.
                We're going to get a dedicated communications link
                that's established between our two devices.

                <br><br>

                Now the third type of switching we have is known as
                <b>message switching</b>. This is where all the
                data is divided into messages, and they're similar
                to <i>packet switching</i> in this idea but the
                messages can actually be <i>stores</i> and <i>forwarded</i>.
                We want to make sure the data is going to get where it's
                going, and that's why <i>message switching</i> can be very
                for us.

                <br><br>

                Almost all of our networks nowadays and the ones you
                utilize are going to be using <i>packet switching</i>.

                The reason is we have other methods that will check if
                something is not getting to the distant end, and will
                be resent over another path until it finally gets there.

                Most of the Internet works by using <i>packet switching</i>.

          </li>

          <h3>Route discovery and selection</h3>

          <li>

                  Next is <i>route discovery and selection</i>
                this is how are we going to decide which path
                we're going to take to send a <i>message</i>.

                Routers maintain a <i>routing table</i> so, they can
                understand how to forward a packet based on the
                destination IP of where it wants to get to.

                <br><br>

                There are lots of different ways that it can do this,
                and they can do this either as
                a <i>static route</i>, or a <i>dynamically-assigned route</i> using
                a <i>routing protocol</i> like <i>RIP</i>, <i>OSPF</i>, & <i>EIGRP</i>.
                <b>Routing protocols</b> help us decide how data is going
                to flow across the network, and how the <i>routers</i> are
                going to communicate that information.

          </li>

          <h3>Connection Services</h3>

          <li>

              <b>Connection services</b> are going to augment
              <i>layer 2 connection services</i> and provide
              us with some additional reliability.
              Again, we're going to have
              some <b>flow control</b> added here, and this is
              going to prevent the sender from sending data faster
              than the receiver can get it.

              <br><br>

              We also have <b>packet reordering</b>. This
              is really important because it allows us to take
              a big chunk of data, cut it up into little pieces
              of <i>packets</i>, and then send all those packets
              off in different directions to get to their final
              destination. A problem that usually arises is that
              packets arrive at the destination in the wrong order.
              <i>Packet reordering</i> allows them to get all this
              data at the end destination at the receiver.
              The benefit here is that because of routing,
              each packet gets numbered and sequenced, and we
              can put them back into the right order.

          </li>

          <h3>Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)</h3>

          <li>

                <b>Internet Control Message Protocol</b> (<b>ICMP</b>) is
                is used to send messages and operational information to
                an IP destination.
                The most commonly used one is <b>ping</b>.
                <i>Ping</i> sends out a packet and tells us if it was
                received or not by the distant end and how long it
                took.
                This is not a tool used regularly by end-user applications,
                but it is used by us as adminstrators to help troubleshoot
                our network.

                <br><br>

                Another variation is known as <b>traceroute</b>,
                which will trace thr route that a packet takes
                through the network and tells you every single
                router along the way as it goes through.

          </li>

          <h3>Layer 3 devices</h3>

          <li>

                Now lets look at some <i>layer 3 devices</i> that
                we need to remember for the exam.
                The first two are <i>routers</i>, and
                <i>multilayer switches</i>.

                <br><br>

                A <b>router</b> looks like this icon below, a circle
                with four arrows. This is a depiction of what a
                router looks like in a <i>logical diagram</i>.

                <br><br>
                <img src="img/exp16.png" alt="example" class="re-size">
                <br><br>

                A <i>multilayer switch</i> works like a <i>switch</i>,
                and <i>router</i> combined. It has both features of
                a <i>layer 2</i> switch, and a <i>layer 3</i> router.
                Remember that a switch is always a <i>layer 2</i> device,
                unless it's a multilayer switch, which will then be a <i>layer 3</i> device.

          </li>

          <h2 class="tittles space">Layer 4 (Transport Layer)</h2>

          <h3>Lower/Upper layers</h3>

          <li>

                At <b>layer 4</b> we have the <b>transport layer</b>.
                Now, the transport layer is our dividing line between
                what we call the <i>upper layers</i> of the OSI model and
                the <i>lower layers</i> of the OSI model.

                <br><br>

                Now the <b>lower layers</b> consist of
                <i>physical</i>, <i>data link</i>, & <i>network</i> layers.
                While the <b>upper layers</b> consist of <i>transport</i>,
                <i>session</i>, <i>presentation</i>, & <i>application</i> layer.

          </li>

          <h3>TCP & UDP protocols</h3>

          <li>

                 <b>Transmission control protocol</b> (<b>TCP</b>) is a
                 <i>connection oriented protocol</i> is a reliable
                 way to transport segments across our network.
                 Now, if a segment has dropped, the protocol will
                 ask for acknowledgment each and every time.
                 If it doesn't get that acknowledgement, it's going to
                 resend that piece of information.
                 For this reason we call is a <i>connection full protocol</i>, because
                 it has this two-way type of information.

                <br><br>
                <img src="img/exp18.png" alt="example" class="re-size">
                <br><br>

                Now, let's look at the diagram above.
                Here we have a client on the left, and a
                server on the right.
                The client is going to send what's called
                a <b>synchronization packet</b> (<b>SYN packet</b>)

          </li>

          <h3>Three-way handshake</h3>

    <h3>Host</h3>

    <li>
          <br><br>

          <b>Host</b> are any device which <i>sends</i> or
          <i>receive</i> traffic.
          (Examples : Computers, Phones, smart TVs, smart watches, etc)

          <br><br>

          Host typically fall in two categories <i>clients</i> or
          <i>servers</i>. <b>Clients</b> initiate request <b>servers</b>
          respond. These terms are relative to specific communication.
          (A <i><b>server</b></i> is a computer with software installed
           which responds to specific request)

    </li>

    <h3>IP Address</h3>

    <li>

          An <b>IP Address</b> is the identity of each host.
          An <i>IP address</i> is needed to send or
          receieve <i>packets</i> on a network.
          <i>IP addresses</i> get stamped on everything
          that each <i>host</i> sends.

          <br><br>
          <img src="img/exp18.png" alt="example" class="re-size">
          <br><br>

          For example when a client makes a web request to <i>site.com</i>, it
          sends a <b>packet</b> which includes <i>what web page it is asking for</i>, as
          well as a <i>source ip address</i>, and a <i>destination ip addresses</i>.

          <br><br>

          The <b>source ip address</b> is going to be the client's ip address,
          and the <b>destination ip address</b> is going to be the server's ip
          address.

          <br><br>

          <i>IP addresses</i> are typically assigned in some sort
          of hierachy.

          <br><br>
          <img src="img/exp19.png" alt="example" class="re-size">
          <br><br>

    </li>

    <h3>Network</h3>

    <li>

      A <b>network</b> is what actually does the transportation of
      traffic between hosts. In it's simplest form anytime you connect
      two hosts you have a <i>network</i>.

      <br><br>

      Before networks in order to transfer data between hosts required
      portable media (disks, thumb drives, etc...).

      <br><br>

      A network is really just a logical grouping of hosts which
      require similar connectivity. Networks can contain other
      networks which is reffered to as <b>Sub-Networks</b> (<b>Subnets</b>).

      <br><br>

      Instead of having networks connect directly to each
      other in every possible combination, networks are connected
      to a central resource, the <b>internet</b> which is simply
      a bunch of <i>interconnected networks</i>, networks connected
      to other networks.

      <li><b>Hubs</b> are multiport repeaters.</li>
      
      <h3>Bridge</h3>
      <li><b>Bridges</b> sit between <i>HUB</i> connected hosts.</li>

    <h1 class="tittles space">OSI model</h1>

    <h3>Intro</h3>

    <li>

          The purpose of <i>networking</i> is to allow
          two hosts to share data with one another.
          <i>Networking</i> allows us to automate all this
          across the wire. <i>Hosts</i> must follow a set of rules
          in order to achive this.
          <i>Networking</i> also has its own set of rules, the rules
          for networking are divided into seven different layers
          known as the <b>OSI model</b>.

      <br><br>

      <mark>OSI is simply a model, NOT RIGID.</mark>

          <br><br>

        <img src="img/exp2.gif" alt="example" class="re-size">
        <br><br>

      1) Physical ; <mark>Transporting bits</mark> ; Cables, Wifi, Repeaters, & Hubs
      <br>
      2) Data Link ; <mark>Hop to hop</mark> ; NIC, MAC Address, Routers, Switch
      <br>
      3) Network ; <mark>End to end</mark> ; IP Address 
      <br>
      4) Transport ; <mark>Service to Service</mark> ; 
         Two common address schemes to distinguish dates streams
         are <b>TCP</b> & <b>UDP</b> which are <b>ports</b>.

         <i>TCP</i> favors reliability. <i>UDP</i> favots efficiency.
        Port #s range from 0-65535. 

        <br><br> 

        Servers listen for request to pre-defined <i>ports</i>.
        Clients make request to the IP address & to the port # in question.
        Clients also select a random <b>source port</b> for each 
        connection. 

        <br><br> 

        When a packet is initially send from a client it 
        includes a <b>Source</b> (<b>SRC</b>) & <b>Destination</b> (<b>DST</b>)
        
          <br><br>
          <img src="img/exp22.png" alt="example" class="re-size">
          <br><br>
          
          ??This process occurs for each connection made the client 
          the client. In each case the client is searching a new 
          random source port. 

          <br><br>

          <i>Ports</i> ensure that the right application gets the 
          right data. THis process also allows the client to make 
          multiple connections to the sme server. 
          (exp : when client/browser opens a new tab, a new random 
          source port is created.)

                        A <b>node</b> is a device the implements IP.
                        A <b>router</b> is a <i>node</i> that forwards <i>IP packets</i> not
                        explicitly to itself.
                        A <b>host</b> is any <i>node</i> that is not a router.

                        A router forwards packets not destined to themselves.
                        Routers are <i>connected</i> to a network by having 
                        an IP & MAC address on <i>each interface</i> (<i>network</i>).
                        To do this routers must have a <b>routing table</b> corrilating
                        to each route in <i>each network</i>. 
                        Each route has its own routing table. 

                        <br><br>

                                    
                        Routers use the routing tables to send <i>packets</i>.
                        <i>Routing tables</i> can be populated via 3 methods ;
                        <i>Directly Connected</i>, <i>Static Routes</i>, 
                        & <i>Dynamic Routers</i>. 

                        <br><br>

                        <b>Directly connected</b> are routes for the Network which are
                        attached. 
                        When routes receive packets with an unknown <i>destination IP</i>, 
                        packet is dropped.

                        <b>Static routes</b> are routes manually 
                        provided by an <i>administrator</i>.

                  <h3>Everything Routers Do Pt2</h3>

                  <li>

                          A <b>ARP</b> is the mapping of known IP address to unknown
                          MAC address. 
                          Routers have <b>ARP Tables</b>, mapping of <i>L3</i> to <i>L2</i> address.
                          (Everying with an <i>IP address</i> has an <i>ARP Table</i>.

                        <br><br>

                        <br><br>

                        ARP Tables start empty & get populated dynamically 
                        as needed with network traffic.
